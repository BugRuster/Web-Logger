# Terminal Web Logger (v0.1.0)

The Python script above demonstrates how to use the requests library to log in to a website. The script sends an HTTP POST request to the login page with the provided login credentials and handles the response.

First, the script imports the requests library and sets the login URL and credentials. It then creates a Session object to persist cookies across requests. The script uses the post() method of the Session object to send the login request with the provided headers and login data. If the response status code is 200, the script prints a message indicating that the login was successful. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the login failed. The script also includes error handling using a try-except block to catch and print any RequestException that may occur during the HTTP request.

By Replacing YOUR_USERNAME, YOUR_PASSWORD and YOUR_URL you can login through your Terminal.

This is the Unique and a programmer way to LOGIN into the Web-Sites.
